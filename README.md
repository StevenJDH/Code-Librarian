# Code Librarian
This program stores and organizes your code snippets in any programming language with its easy to use features. I originally built this because I didn’t like the ones I saw on the internet and decided to make something I felt was better. The program is very useful for people who are starting out in programming and for advanced programmers who need a place to store their snippets for reuse. The program was also designed to work with teams and with third-party code where crediting information will need to be saved.

## Features
* Able to open other people's databases for view or editing.
* You can choose either to have the list panel placed at the left or right side of the program for comfort.
* A built-in super quick search engine to find your code records fast. Search by keywords/Language/Author/ or all three.
* Easily add/update/delete your code records.
* Add/update/delete authors, contact info, and languages for future use so you don't have to retype them.
* A language filter to filter out everything except what you want to see.
* Displayed at bottom, the amount of code records contained in the database.
* Popup descriptions on pretty much everything incase you have any problems, although everything should be self explanitory.
* Create backups of your database.
* Use Code Librarian with different accounts on same computer.

## TODO
* There is one block of messy code left over from when I originally developed version 1.0 in VB 6.0 when I was about 13 years old that didn't get cleaned up when I ported it to VB .Net, so this will be the next step. After, I plan to migrate to a more portable database format.
* Decouple database code and correct a lot of bad habits I had when I originally created this, including a better database design. Overall, it'll probably be a massive rewrite...

## Why am I contributing?
This is just one of many tools and applications I’ve created over the years for myself that I thought I should share with the public. I am new to GitHub so bear with me while I get adjusted. Hopefully, with community support, some of these applications will grow into something better.
